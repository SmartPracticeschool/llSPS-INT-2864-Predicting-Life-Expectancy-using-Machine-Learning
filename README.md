# llSPS-INT-2864-Predicting-Life-Expectancy-using-Machine-Learning
Predicting Life Expectancy using Machine Learning using python.
Here we use numpy , pandas,scikit-learn libraries.
This problem is solved using linear regression technique.
In the dataset there are 2938 rows and 22 columns.
We have to predict life expectancy which is linearly dependant on some factors like alchohol, adult mortality , hepatities B etc.
Here we take all attributes in X except life expectancy column and life expectancy in Y.
We split the data in training and testing set in 70:30 ratio.
The linear regression model gives a good r-square value , which proves that the model is good.
We also us streamlit library to view the output by putting inputs.
